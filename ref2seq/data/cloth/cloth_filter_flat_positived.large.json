The explanations of basic tools and techniques are written clearly and for those without any jewelry making experience, it all makes sense!  Once you learn the how tos of working with different organic elements, the book teaches you numerous beginner and intermediate projects. Again, the photography is exceptional and the instructions easy to understand.\n\nIf you've had the desire to learn jewelry making, especially using sea glass or other natural elements,  I highly recommend this book to you!",

Brice is an ass, plain and simple. He may have a past that has shaped him into that but I just couldn't warm up to him.  While I liked Lena, the fact that she doesn't call Brice on his crappy behavior drove me nuts.  The other thing that had me a bit crazy was the fact that these two couldn't seem to just sit down and have a conversation.  Avoidance on both their parts just made things worse than they needed to be.\n\nAs I stated though it does have a good story and because I have enjoyed all the other books from this author I will definitely be reading the next in this series.

But when Brice found out about his existence, he regretted the choices he made in the past....Choosing success over family and relations.\n\nThere was no turning back the hands of time only looking forward to the future with Lena and Nicholas. ONE WHITE LIE was fascinating. Love Dominic Corisi, Trent and many more making an appearance.\n\nThis is my first book by Jeannette Winters, I'm thrilled that she's working with one of my favorite authors, Ruth Caredello and I can't wait for what they have in store for us with this amazing series.",

    "reviewText": "This book was a solid 4 stars for me. I did not forsee Brice having the attitude and determination of his partner Asher. When I first met him in Always Mine, I thought he was the gentler of the two. HEY, I was SO wrong. Him and Lena relationship or reunited one was tricky. Things ended confussed and hurtful on her part but she never got over the person she once knew. As they say all people change and Brice's change was not for the better.\n\nIt took long nights in a hospital room after some mixed feeling news and a meddling sister for him to learn the truth about Lena. Also, it took clearing a soul before death for him to get closure that held him in a place of stay and go, love from a distance or by her side. I am glad he made the right choice and am excited to see what lies ahead for the other Henderson clan.",

Lena Razzi was dumped by her boyfriend on the evening that she intended to tell him that she was pregnant.  So, for three years she has had to go it alone and provide for her 2 1/2 year old son by herself.  She gets a sudden call from a temporary agency to replace \"Mr. Henderson's\" personal assistant.  She submits her resume, has an over the phone interview and is hired to start immediately.  (Yeah, like big shot company owners would let this happen.  Hah!)  The first morning she walks into the office and...TA-DAH...there is her former lover and father of her child.  He is NOT happy to see her and demands that she leave.  She talks him into giving her a trial run.  One week later she goes into his office and they strip off their clothes and have hot sex.  Hmm.  See how this is going?  It doesn't get any better...or any more believable or any more interesting, either.\n\nMost of this book is made up of characters talking to themselves.  I don't mind a little of that but page after page after page is mind-numbing.  I started counting pages (yeah, you can see how interested I was in this story!) and there would be 4 or 5 pages of this before you would get any dialogue.  The hero(?) was a total a**hole.  He treated his family like crap, all the while complaining about what a heartless bas***d his father was.  The heroine was supposed to be a self-sufficient woman who was only interested in taking care of her son, but turned into mush every time this jerk touched her.  I disliked her as much as I did him.  I'm quite sure that their HEA is only temporary.\n\nSexual situations may offend some readers",

Something had happened in his past, that you kind of find out but are still left with a little mystery. Lena is just trying to make ends meet.

It's easy to get frustrated with the characters and love them at the same time since the reader has X-ray vision and knows both sides of the story. While Brice was an arrogant jerk, he also saw his faults and took responsibility for his behavior. I didn't blame Lena for what she did.... Brice made it clear to her that his 'future' was all that counted and no room for her in it. So, I never saw what Lena did as a 'white lie'.... not when you replay Brice's words to her. She really didn't have much of a choice.\n\nAppreciated the sweet version. Love it when bedroom antics don't get in the way of the storyline.",

Brice had a really tough family life, as his father was abusive. Consequently he feels unworthy of love, and unable to show love and be a good father. As a result, he does not allow relationships to grow serious. The story is not that hard to figure out, but the relationship between father and son is really and his father explains things about his grandmother and his mother. These are really not explained so that the reader understands underlying causes of his father and mothers relationship or if the mom is even still alive. Those were real empty spots in this story. There was too much head speaking happening. I was waiting for solution of the family issues and that was left unresolved. Also he wasn't believing in his worthiness, and she was convinced he would leave her again. Yet both turned on a dime when the time came. I would have liked more time explaining why he left her originally, and what happened to his dad and why, as well as if mom is still alive and can be a positive influence on her kids.",

    "reviewText": "One White Lie is a \"love interrupted\" and \"secret baby\" romance. I personally find it hard to accept why woman would just walk away and keep the baby a secret from the father even if he had wrong her, but that's just my personal opinion. Still, this story, while polished, just didn't grab me.\n\nBrice Henderson broke away from his controlling father to make his own fortune, by sacrificing everything, including the one woman he loved, but he can afford no distractions. When his personal assistant needed to take sick leave to take care of family, Brice reluctantly agreed to hire a temporary replacement... who turned out to be the one woman he pushed away... Lena Razzi. Lena spent years trying to forget Brice, despite having a daily reminder... a son by Brice that not even Brice knew about. Lena needed the job, even if it's just a temporary gig, to take care of the baby and herself, and Brice hasn't changed. But as they spent more time together, neither can forget the good times they once had. Can Lena tell Brice about their son if she's not staying? Can they rekindle their love... Or was this going to be a flash in the pan like last time?\n\nFrankly, I am tired of books that tout doormat single mom keeping the baby secret as if to spite the (bleep) dad just to prove you don't mean anything to me except as sperm donor, but as soon as they see each other, they got back together. It's basically formula that she won't tell him, believing this second time is temporary as well, then he found out and was pissed off, or he think he's damaged and was too good for her, or vice versa... But eventually they got back together. It's a trope, and this is no exception.",

She immediately had relations with him that felt wrong. He ignored her for most of the book. Just the night before the grand gesture he ignored her at an event.  I had no idea why she even said yes.\n\nI guess I was just stunned at the emotional and physical disconnect. I never felt like these two should be a couple.

    "reviewText": "3.5\n\nI'm at lost as how to write this review without spoilers but Ill try my best not to. So.\n\nOne White Lie, the title alone makes you think of possibilities of what that title was about. Honestly though, Ive read quite a lot of novels with the same premise of story. When I got a hit after a few chapters what the one white lie is, I kind of wonder how the author will take such a plot that will make it different than the others. Not comparing authors, but one of the stories with almost the same story line that I loved was written by Melody Anne and deep inside I wished it wouldnt go the same way. And it did not. That part of the story was given justice very well and Id say the author was able to make the plot her own even though its been commonly used and almost a clich.\n\nI was just a little disappointed with the lack of dialogues. I know narrations shape up the story. Its what give foundation and backbone to take a story where you want to lead it to. Its how you move forward. But for me, dialogues are the soul. Its what gives life to a good plot. And I even tried to scroll through out the whole book after I was done reading and I noticed there are chapters without a single dialogue in it. Thoughts by the characters narrated are good, it gives clarifications as to how a character is feeling at a certain point and gives justice to their actions. But I felt like there are a lot of scenes that would have gone better if the characters were at least talking to somebody even if they do not want to talk with each other.\n\nI have grown to love Jeannette Winters novels but I cannot say that I enjoyed this one as much as I did her previous novels. But don't get me wrong, the story as a whole was still good even if I don't like the way it was written. And Id still definitely look forward to the next book in the series.",

Each installment links each authors installment through certain characters and events. So, we have Jeannette, her sister Ruth Cardellos and niece Dannielle Stewart. Each author lovingly crafts a romance story that is compelling and you keep turning pages to find out what happens next. The Synchronized series is called The Barrington Billionaires. I would be missing a major component for a romance book and that is each author writes steamy hot passion and you may need to buy a fan.\n\nIn the first installment, we have already met Brice Henderson in Ms. Cardellos Always Mine.  He is Asher Barringtons partner and was the scientist half of the partnership. When Lena Razzi was offered an opportunity of a lifetime and she took the deal. Even if it meant she would have to work for Brice who had broken her heart into tiny pieces 3 years ago.\n\nBrice is always working. He never taking time off.  If he has needs, he beds a woman that understands that there is nothing more than a physical relationship.  He traded everything for Power & Success. The newest deal that he and Asher had on the table would cement his spot at the TOP. Brice was given a new deadline by Asher and now he had to focus on his job and Lena working for him, even for 1 month, had the potential to lose that focus and that was not acceptable.\n\nWhen Brice and Lena were even close to each other, their attraction had not waned at all.  Brice wanted to have a fling with no strings attached, but is that even possible. When Brice and Ashers company and employees may be at risk, Brice decides to take Lena to his home to protect her.\n\nWill Brice and Lena have a second chance? Will he forgive her when he finds out there was a consequence to their love 3 years ago.  Has Brice even changed his mind about marriage and a family?  Find out.  You won't regret getting this wonderful story.",

A definite must have for every knitter!  I could even use some of these hats to decorate my house until I find a baby to give them to! I hope that this is the first of many books by Susan Anderson!",

It works up well in cotton as well as wool and color combinations are so much fun to select. Take the author's advice to cast on and bind off tightly to make the topper curly.  My only complaint is that my book's pages are not consecutive - pages 49 through 64 were inserted after page 32.  Thankfully all pages are there, just not in the right order.",

Nothing bigger.\nMost of the pattern variations are made with colour changes and toppers.\nThe pictures are gorgeous and the patterns work!\nThere are a few errors in the patterns that are pretty easy to work around, and with minor modifications you can vary the final look to your own taste, eg the dropped daisy hat in many on the customer images has quite small petals and a very long stem (by pattern) but can be easily changed to suit yourself.\nThere are quite a few patterns; I would make most of them, and have made 5 of them in the last 4 weeks.\n\nAddendum: I made the dropped daisy hat in a soft pink wool with a lemon daisy for my 2+ yo.  First off, she refuses to remove it - it goes on when she gets up and comes off only to sleep.  Secondly it was easy to make but looks so effective.  And thirdly, we get compliments everywhere we go.  I have never had this happen before - everyone we meet says \"gorgeous hat\", \"love the hat\", etc.  What more can you want?

There are a number of pages in the front that explain basic knitting techniques which I imagine would be useful to a beginner.",

They took my request and made sure that my masks arrived quickly. Though you could tell that English wasn't their first language, they communicated quite clearly and I was able to read their emails without confusion. I give them a 10/10 for their great customer service.\n\nThe masks are great too. When you order these though, remember that they all come in different sizes, and by that I mean the eye and mouth holes. One of the masks fit me perfectly, and the other one I ordered has one eye hole bigger than the other. I would recommend buying two of these, just in case one of them doesn't fit you. Also, the space between the eyes isn't held together too well, but with basic sowing skill this can easily be fixed. I give the mask a 7/10: It does its job, but the quality it arrives in is unpredictable.",

So I was out on a lunch break, working night shift at 2am, when a squad car pulls up and the cop gets out, telling me to stop and come over.  He asks, \"What's with the ski mask?\"  And I don't think I have to explain why I would be wearing a ski mask in a blizzard, so I just put my hands out, indicating the snow that was everywhere.\n\nHe seemed to get the picture, but then said, \"Well, we got a call.\"  (Which is a blanket excuse to harass people)  \"Could you at least show me your face?\"  So, I pulled up the skimask, showing my friendly face, as a courtesy.  Then he asks for my ID, and I respectfully refuse.  (As is my right, legally and in general)  I explain to him that I have no legal obligation to show my ID.\n\nBut then he goes off on a lecture about \"Well, in today's world--blah, blah, blah\", he of course mentions 9/11 and any other excuse he can remember from the rotten cop handbook, and I already know how to respond to this crap, so I'm just waiting for him to stop moving his stupid mouth.  When he finally does, I tell him straight out:  \"Today's world is FREEZING.  So I'm wearing a skimask.  Am I being detained, or are we done here?\"  (That question is paramount when dealing with police)\n\nAnd as if I'd shown him a federal badge, his whole posture changes, he lowers his head and waves me off, \"Have a nice night.\"  And that was it.\n\nI know this story has little to do with reviewing the skimask itself, but I felt I'd said enough when selecting five stars and \"Fit as expected\".  I'm simply getting this little moment off my chest, as I'm kinda proud of it.  These are the times where we need to show the machine who the human is.",

Now, theres two things that absolutely ruin thigh highs for me; the first is when the nylon material is cheap quality and you don't even get them on and they snag.  These are NOT those thigh highs.\n\nThese are a very sheer material, so I was worried they would easily rip or get runs in them, but I was able to successfully put them on and wear them for a few hours with no rips or runs.  Obviously they're still nylon and not indestructible, but they aren't cheaply made and going to run as soon as you put them on.\n\nThe 2nd thing that ruins thigh highs for me is when the elastic on the band at the top doesnt keep the thigh highs up.  I don't necessarily want the world knowing Im wearing thigh highs and I don't want to have to tug them up non-stop and these stay up very well.  Theres plenty of elastic on these to keep them in place and not have to constantly adjust.  Im definitely pleased with these thigh highs.\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.",

It should be noted that the top or the panty is not support and does not bind but stays up well. They are a dream to wear and will go with my pants all and nice skirt . They are opaque enough to hide my varicose veins and still be stylish to wear.

    "reviewText": "I now have 4 of the 5 available colors of this shirt... and I'm considering buying the 5th. The material is super soft and very flattering, and it's easy to nurse discreetly in this top. It did take me a few tries to figure out how to get from fully covered to latched without flashing people nearby, but I pretty quickly figured out what worked for me and my baby, and now I don't even have to mess with nursing covers, which is great because my daughter refuses to nurse when covered (and I can hardly blame her). I'm rather large-chested (I honestly don't even know my breastfeeding bra size... I was a 40D pre-baby and those bras are too small now), so I've had a hard time finding nursing tops that are flattering, comfortable, discreet, and modest. This shirt is all of those things. And that's why I have four of them. :)\n\nAt my family's huge Christmas Eve party this year, I couldn't find an empty room to nurse my daughter, so we just found a corner and nursed there (see pic for that outfit). My sister came up and started talking to me and it took her a minute to realize I was breastfeeding, rather than just snuggling my sleepy baby.\n\nI have several other styles of nursing tops and dresses, and this is by FAR my favorite. I recommend it to every breastfeeding mom I know, and I'm about to get a couple for my cousin for her baby shower gift (and possibly the dress of this style for myself, to wear to her shower...).",

I am 5'9\" 140 pounds and can NEVER find tights that stay in the right spot and actually come all the way up the way they're supposed to. I always had a baggy crotch or had to stuff my toes in them to get them to reach all the way up. These are just amazing. I am so thankful I finally found a brand of tights I can wear. Now I have so many options when getting dolled up in the colder months as I would always just throw on jeans instead of trying to wear skirts or dressss cause I'd have to be bare legged.

I'm always nervous to buy clothes online, but after reading the reviews I decided to go for it as I wanted something comfy and semi-formal for my baby shower.\nI'm 5' 6\", currently 30wks along, weigh about 250 at the moment, and am very big chested (42DDD+). This top STILL hit all the marks, its very comfy, flattering on my bump (and everywhere else), and once baby comes I feel like I will be able to nurse with ease.\nI ordered an XL after reading reviews, it is more of a tunic length (as I expected/hoped it would be), flowy around my bump leaving room to grow, and fits my chest/shoulders/arms well. Still playing around with some different knots. :)\nWould definitely  re-order.\n\nI wasn't offered anything to review this product, just being so prego and having a versatile cute top work out after ordering online is very exciting! lol",

The number one thing you want to know when you're nursing is 'can I get my boobs out quickly'?? And this is such a cool dress and it's got the easy access.\n\nI ordered an XL because I usually wear XL shirts and it's comfy for me and fits perfectly. The pictures aren't the most flattering that I'm posting with this, but I will be wearing this to parties and weddings even because I can get my daughter fed right away when she needs it, and it's a way to be dressy without feeling uncomfortable. I love that I can tie it either in the front or the back, if I tie in the front it hangs down the front and if you tie it in the back it's got a much shorter hanging part. Either way, I think it's really pretty.\n\nThe dress itself is soft and the color is beautiful (the lighting in my basement is fluorescent so it's not what you would call great for pictures) but it's actually a really deep purple that looks great with my skin tone. I am hoping to be pregnant soon and I know this will be a perfect way to keep myself comfortable when we may feel our most uncomfortable ever. *I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",

The color isn't the greatest, it would be nicer if it was a deeper saturation to the green, to me it looks more grey than olive but it's still very nice.  It fits as expected, is loose and generous with the fabric around the waist and in the chest area.  Nursing mothers will find this dress allows for easy access and you can use the wrap portion of the dress to discreetly hold the baby as well.\n\nEven if you aren't nursing, this is a loose, flowing dress that is flattering on all figures for the summer.  You can tie the dress in front in different ways too for different looks.  Overall this dress meets my expectations and is well made.  I'd be glad to recommend it to others.

It's very flowy in a flattering way and has a modest neckline and length. I'm 5' and about 125 lbs at 3 weeks postpartum and it's been great to nurse in (I ordered a small). It is a little long, but I actually like that because I know I can juggle my 3 year old, 2 year old, and newborn without tugging my shirt down. It does look a little awkward with shorts (bc I'm so short) but would be really cute with capris or pants/tights and boots. The ties are a little long for my frame (when tied in the front, the ends hang pretty low) but they are long enough that I just cross in the front and tie in the back (I'm still able to nurse without untying it). The deep purple is a beautiful color. My only concern is that it may be pretty hot in the worst of summer (I live in Pheonix area) due to the fabric type and the crossover style which means double layer of fabric. But it's very cute and I love it!",

I've remedied this by putting a burp rag under baby's mouth while feeding which is easy, but it annoying that breast milk is so noticeable on a dress designed for nursing.",

My family and decided to take a spontaneous beach trip after a church event. So this dress is good for just about any occasion and any environment!\nSince we didn't plan this beach trip I didn't have shade. So, after I nursed her to sleep the flaps on this dress were the perfect thing to help shield her from the sun. These flaps are so nice to discretely feed my baby. Anyone passing by didn't even notice I was feeding her. Then when I'm done nursing I wrap it back around and tie it in the back, it hardly looks like it's meant to be a nursing dress. This was worth the purchase.\nAt the time these pics were taken I was 5weeks postpartum 5'3 175lbs.",

I ordered a medium (5'4\", 145lbs, 5 months postpartum), and a small would've fit if my breasts (34F) were a bit smaller. I probably could've worn this size during pregnancy, and my belly got HUGE. I love that the tie around covers the nursing holes- I have other shirts with nursing holes that I have to watch out for or else I'll hang out of them. The waist is highly adjustable. The neckline keeps my cleavage covered. No problems after washing. I wanted to buy more in other colors, but I'm disappointed that the price has increased since my purchase. It's still worth it. The only negative (other than the price increase) is that you can't put this dress back on with one hand. I had to hand my baby off to get re-situated, but it's worth it to have such a well-designed access area!",

The nursing slits will be very easy to use for breastfeeding.  The material is like a heavier t-shirt material, and the tie can be done three different ways (front, side and back...all very cute).  I read some reviews that complained about wrinkles.  Mine arrived without many wrinkles, so I am hopeful that wrinkles will not be an issue.  Size info:  I was 5'4\" and 120 lbs prepregnancy, and I am currently 145 lbs at 35 weeks pregnant.  The small fits me very well.  I would not want it any larger.

Some, I have found, are different fabrics--the grey shirt is thicker than the pink and black colored shirts.  Additionally, two of them (the grey and pink ones) are starting to pill a bit.  That being said, they have generally held up very well in the wash (and the dryer...).  A few reviewers said they were too heavy for summer/hot-weather wear.  I would agree.  I currently live on a tropical island and the shirts are just too heavy (or too much fabric?) to wear outside in the heat & humidity.  The dresses breathe a bit more though, and I can go outside in them... as long as I am OK with sweat showing through.  The shirts are very long and if I wasn't planning to hand these down to my sisters when they get pregnant, I would have gotten them tailored to be MUCH shorter--now that I'm at my pre-pregnancy weight the only thing the shirts look good with are leggings/yoga pants.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI love this dress! I bought it after buying and loving a few of the shirts produced by the same company.  The purple color is as shown in the pictures online.  The fabric is a touch thin, but holds up well in the washer/dryer and I haven't noticed any shrinkage.  For sizing purposes, I am 5'9\" and 150 lbs post-pregnancy and the size small fits perfectly (if anything, it's a touch big).  When I get back to my pre-pregnancy weight of 135, I'm sure the dress will still fit very well based on the cut and the ability to cinch it with the tying ends.\n\nThe ONLY downside is that because this is a pregnancy dress, the front of the dress is cut longer than the back.  Thus, if you are in your third trimester, the bottom of the dress hem will be perfectly even and parallel to the ground... not so much when you no longer have the baby bump!",

I love the material...it reminds me of the jersey knit material.\n\n I bought a similar maternity dress at target but it didn't have access for nursing like this dress does. I wasn't able to wear that dress after pregnancy. This dress is amazing because it had access for nursing! I love that you can tie the dress as you would like. It flows nicely and the material is soft and stretchy. I'm not currently pregnant and it hits me below the knee so during pregnancy it will be perfect! If you are breastfeeding just be sure to adjust the fabric afterwards. I noticed the layer underneath can get bunchy  so just readjust it and it will lay properly.\nI will probably be purchasing it in another color as well!!\nI received this product for free in exchange for testing, inspecting and reviewing it. I received no other compensation for my review and always give my honest and unbiased opinion the product.",

Wearing it as a nursing top also but preferred it has a maternity top.  Wish there were more colors or prints.",
