A30FG02C424EJ5	0871167043	I highly recommend this book.  It's written for those new to the craft of jewelry making and those with more experience who want to expand their skill set. I have some jewelry making experience and consider my skills intermediate to advanced, and I'm pleased to say this book is now on my book shelf.  Beth Martin and Eva Sherman are excellent teachers and it comes through in this book.  They take you from the fundamentals of tools and material choices,to technique basics of a wrapped loop,to texturing,and even the use of a torch.  The instructions are clearly written and easy to follow. The projects are beautiful and will offer a chance for those new to jewelry making to expand on the skills you learn as you move from what they designate as beginner to intermediate.  Great purchase

A62O7C5RQB353	0871167042	This has got to be my favorite wire and glass book
AA7PNT2OPS3RP	0871167042	There's nothing prissy or matchy-matchy about the designs in this book.  The authors have presented jewelry that appears to have sprung full-grown from the earth, sea, and/or sky.  I was inspired by nearly every page.I've been fortunate to have taken classes with Eva, and if you have the opportunity I urge you to do the same
