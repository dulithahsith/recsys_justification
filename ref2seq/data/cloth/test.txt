A1G26EYQGW3YF1	0871167042	I like cold connections, so I'm constantly in search of books that demo connections without solder.  What a wonderful surprise! When I saw the cover, I wasn't sure if I was going to like the designs.  Well, I found this book amazing!  Contains some really nice designs and techniques are shown.  Yeah, there are few times when a torch is used, but for the most part, many of the designs don't require heat.  For that, I am thankful

AA7PNT2OPS3RP	0871167041	Hi, have been making jewelry now for the last 5 years and love the use of nature and using natural materials.  The cuff bracelet uses a lot of wire; however, the outcome is beautiful.  Especially if you patina the copper with antique black and tumble it for 30 minutes or so afterwards
